## Closed (walk)
SOLN A walk is closed if it begins and ends with the same vertex
## Trail
SOLN A trail is a walk in which no two vertices appear consecutively (in either order) more than once (i.e. no edge is used more than once)
## Tour
SOLN A tour is a closed trail
## Euler trail
SOLN An Euler trail is a trail in which every pair of adjacent vertices appear consecutively (every edge is used exactly once)
## Euler tour
SOLN An Euler tour is a closed Euler trail
## Hamilton cycle

## Hamilton path

# Graph Questions

## How do you tell if simple, connected graph G has an Euler tour?
It has an Euler tour if and only if every vertex in the graph has even valency
## How do you tell if simple, connected graph G has an Euler trail?
It has an Euler trail if and only if at most two of its vertices have odd valency
